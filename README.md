[Live Demo](https://golden-shoe-live-example.herokuapp.com)

# Requirements

Your application should have at least features in [Must have](#must-have), things in [Nice to have](#nice-to-have) is optional (but yeah, it's attractive if you have).

### Must have:

- Display all products in `Our Products` section (for products data please check from [Technical Requirements](#technical-requirements)):
  - Single product should have name, description, price, image and `Add To Cart` button.
  - User able to click on `Add To Cart` to add target product to their cart.
  - Added product doesn't have `Add To Cart` button anymore, it should have `Check Mark Icon (âœ“)` instead.
- Display all added products in `Your Cart` section:
  - Each product in cart should have name, price, image, increase/decrease amount button and remove button.
  - User able to increase/decrease amount of a product in cart. When product's amount is decreased to zero, that product will be removed from cart naturally.
  - User able to remove product from cart.
  - Show total price of all products in car. When user increase/decrease product's amount or remove product, total price should be re-calculate correctly.
  - When there are no products in cart, we should show `Your cart is empty` message.
  - Products in cart should be persistent: When user visit the application, products are added before should be showed, user don't need to add products again.
- UI must follow correctly design from [live demo](https://golden-shoe-live-example.herokuapp.com).

### Nice to have:

- Responsive design (look good on all devices: desktops, tablets & mobile phones).
- Smooth animations (don't really need to be same as the demo, just do what you think is good).
- Deploy the application to heroku.
